  Problem Statement:
      Titanic ship that crashed in April, 1912.
      Real-world data containing the details of titanic ships passengers list.
      There were lifeboats for only 1178 people
      There were 2224 passengers on board
      Answer the Following:
      0. Total number of Passengers in the dataset
      0. Find all large families (Sibsp > 3)
      0. Find all the features which has missing
      0. Drop the column which has the max missing
      0. Embarked Feature missing values needs to be fixed
      0. Age missing value needs to be fixed
      1. How many people survived the disaster ?
      2. How many people died the disaster ?
      3. Plot the people who survived Vs died appropriately.
      4. Calculate and print the survival rates as proportions (percentage) 
      5. Which gender have greater survival rate ?
         Were females given high priority while rescue.
         Males that survived vs males that passed away
         Females that survived vs Females that passed away
         Also plot it
      6. Does age play a role for survival?
         Since it's probable that children were saved first.
  
  Advanced Problem Statements:
     7. Does Pclass feature plays role in survival
         Survived Vs Died according to Pclass and sex
         Plot it (FactorPlot and CrossTab)
      8. Who was the oldest person survived 
      9. Yougest person survived
      10. Is there a relationship between Pclass and the survival 
          Draw violen plots PClass and Age Vs Survived 
          Sex and Age Vs Survived 
      11. Find the title from the name and show its value counts
          train['title'] = train.Name.str.extract('\, ([A-Z][^ ]*\.)',expand=False)
      12. If a passanger is alone in ship with no siblings, survival rate is 
          If I have a family onboard, I will save them instead of saving myself.
          But there’s something wrong, the survival rate for families 
          with 5–8 members is 0%. Is this because of PClass? Yes this is PClass,
          large families in Pclass3(>3) died.
      13. Everything except ‘PassengerId’, ‘Ticket’ and ‘Name’ would be 
          correlated with a high survival rate
      14. Do Not Delete the Cabin Column, but recreate using Deck
      
      
      To calculate this, you can use the value_counts() method in 
      combination with standard bracket notation to select a single column of
      a DataFrame
 
     You can test this by creating a new column with a Child. 
      Child will take the value 1 in cases where age is less than 18, 
      and a value of 0 in cases where age is greater than or equal to 18.

      Compare the normalized survival rates for those who are <18 and 
      those who are older. 
    
      To add this new variable you need to do two things
        1.     create a new column, and
        2.     Provide the values for each observation (i.e., row) based on the age of the passenger.

  Problem Statement:
    (usagov_bitly_data.json)
    In 2011, URL shortening service Bitly partnered with the US government website
    USA.gov to provide a feed of anonymous data gathered from users who shorten links
    ending with .gov or .mil. 
    In 2011, a live feed as well as hourly snapshots were available
    as downloadable text files. 
    This service is shut down at the time of this writing (2017),
    but we preserved one of the data files.
    In the case of the hourly snapshots, each line in each file contains a common form of
    web data known as JSON. (Use usagov_bitly_data.txt file from Resources)

    Replace the 'nan' values with 'Mising' and ' ' values with 'Unknown' keywords
    Print top 10 most frequent time-zones from the Dataset i.e. 'tz', with and without Pandas
    Count the number of occurrence for each time-zone
    Plot a bar Graph to show the frequency of top 10 time-zones (using Seaborn)
    From field 'a' which contains browser information and separate out browser capability(i.e. the first token in the string eg. Mozilla/5.0)
    Count the number of occurrence for separated browser capability field and plot bar graph for top 5 values (using Seaborn)
    Add a new Column as 'os' in the dataset, separate users by 'Windows' for the values in  browser information column i.e. 'a' that contains "Windows" and "Not Windows" for those who don't

   Let's say we want to find games released for the Xbox One 
   that have a score of more than 7.
   
   review distribution for the Xbox One vs the review distribution 
   for the PlayStation 4.We can do this via a histogram, which will plot the 
   frequencies for different score ranges.
   
   
   
  Hint:

    The columns contain information about that game:

    score_phrase — how IGN described the game in one word. 
                   This is linked to the score it received.
    title — the name of the game.
    url — the URL where you can see the full review.
    platform — the platform the game was reviewed on (PC, PS4, etc).
    score — the score for the game, from 1.0 to 10.0.
    genre — the genre of the game.
    editors_choice — N if the game wasn't an editor's choice, Y if it was. This is tied to score.
    release_year — the year the game was released.
    release_month — the month the game was released.
    release_day — the day the game was released.
